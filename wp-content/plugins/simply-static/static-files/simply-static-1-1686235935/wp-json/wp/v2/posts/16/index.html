They were not known before,&#8221; said Julio Vazquez, the 43-year-old head chef at the El Campero restaurant in the coast town of Barbate.<\/p>\n<p>His menu includes 32 different dishes using bluefin tuna.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When my mother or my grandmother cooked, there was not so much diversity,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Delicacy&#8217;<br \/>\nVazquez recalled that the bestselling Spanish cookbook &#8220;1080 Recipes&#8221; by the late culinary author Simone Ortega had only one tuna recipe &#8212; for a gratin using tinned tuna.<\/p>\n<p>While 80 per cent of the tuna caught in Cadiz used to go to Japan, now 70 per cent is sold in Spain and just 30 per cent heads to Asia, according to OPP51.<\/p>\n<p>Thousands of people head to Cadiz &#8212; a region of whitewashed houses and sandy beaches &#8212; to eat bluefin tuna caught using the &#8220;almadraba&#8221; technique.<\/p>\n<p>The tiny resort town of Zahara de los Atunes &#8212; named after the tuna &#8212; holds an annual festival dedicated to the fish.
