										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the sun rises in the Gulf of Cadiz on Spain&#8217;s southern tip, a team of fishermen lifts the tip of a vast system of nets with bluefin tuna trapped inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoist!&#8221; they cry before men in wetsuits jump into the water to deliver a final blow to the fish captured using this 3,000-year-old netting tradition.</p>
<p>Dubbed an &#8220;almadraba&#8221;, the system of nets is designed to catch large bluefin tuna during their annual migration from the Atlantic into the warmer Mediterranean to lay their eggs.</p>
<p>The nets form a series of chambers that trap only the biggest of the migrating tuna.</p>
<p>The tuna are &#8220;practically like bulls&#8221; and their blows are like &#8220;the kick from a horse,&#8221; said the captain of the fishing boat, 61-year-old Antonio Ponce.</p>
<p>Tuna have been caught in this stretch of water using this method since the Phoenicians ruled the Mediterranean from around 1,200 BC.</p>
<p>Use of the technique in Spain almost disappeared in the 1970s due to a lack of profitability but demand for quality tuna from Japan breathed new life into the sector.</p>
<p>Over 1,600 tonnes of bluefin tuna are caught annually off the coast of Spain&#8217;s southern province of Cadiz using the &#8220;almadraba&#8221; technique.</p>
<p>Around 500 fishermen in Cadiz use the system, according to the Almadraba Producers&#8217; and Fishermen&#8217;s Organisation (OPP51).</p>
<p>Aside from Spain, the technique is only found in Italy, Morocco and Portugal.</p>
<p>&#8216;Sustainable technique&#8217;<br />
Because the nets only catch the biggest tuna, it is a &#8220;sustainable technique,&#8221; said Jose Luis Garcia Varas of the Spanish branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the global popularity of sushi put bluefin tuna in danger but the establishment of regional fishing quotas allowed the species to recover.</p>
<p>Atlantic bluefin tuna was in 2021 moved from the category of &#8220;endangered&#8221; to that of &#8220;least concern&#8221; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
<p>In Spain, the Japanese taught local fishermen to minimise the stress endured by the tuna to improve the taste of the meat.</p>
<p>Fishermen now use a sawn-off shotgun called a &#8220;lupara&#8221; to kill the tuna instantly.</p>
<p>While the structure of the nets &#8220;has remained more or less the same for many years,&#8221; what has changed is &#8220;the way of treating the fish to achieve quality, to take away their suffering,&#8221; said Ponce.</p>
<p>The Japanese also taught locals how to consume parts of the tuna which were previously thrown away &#8212; and got them to eat raw fish.</p>
<p>Bluefin tuna &#8220;has 25 parts, 25 textures, 25 tastes. They were not known before,&#8221; said Julio Vazquez, the 43-year-old head chef at the El Campero restaurant in the coast town of Barbate.</p>
<p>His menu includes 32 different dishes using bluefin tuna.</p>
<p>&#8220;When my mother or my grandmother cooked, there was not so much diversity,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;Delicacy&#8217;<br />
Vazquez recalled that the bestselling Spanish cookbook &#8220;1080 Recipes&#8221; by the late culinary author Simone Ortega had only one tuna recipe &#8212; for a gratin using tinned tuna.</p>
<p>While 80 per cent of the tuna caught in Cadiz used to go to Japan, now 70 per cent is sold in Spain and just 30 per cent heads to Asia, according to OPP51.</p>
<p>Thousands of people head to Cadiz &#8212; a region of whitewashed houses and sandy beaches &#8212; to eat bluefin tuna caught using the &#8220;almadraba&#8221; technique.</p>
<p>The tiny resort town of Zahara de los Atunes &#8212; named after the tuna &#8212; holds an annual festival dedicated to the fish. Last year its bars and restaurants served 105,000 tapas during the four days of the event, according to the town hall.<br />

<p>&#8220;Here is all about freshness,&#8221; said Noah G White, a 23-year-old chef visiting from Sweden, who asked for Vazquez&#8217;s autograph after eating at his restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can eat it raw and that is for me a delicacy in itself,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Lionel Messi transfer saga ended on Wednesday night when the Argentine World Cup winner chose Major League Soccer (MLS) club Inter Miami as his next home.</p>
<p>His decision broke the hearts of the legions of Barcelona fans and football romantics who had envisioned Messi’s triumphant return to the Catalan club after two years ‘exile’ in Paris.</p>
<p>Messi moving to the US, the place which has been the ‘retirement home’ for top European footballers for many years, also signals the end of an era.</p>
<p>For over 15 years, two footballers – Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – battled it out in Europe for the right to be called the best in the world. Both won a plethora of titles for their respective clubs and earned a long list of individual laurels which proclaimed their greatness to the world.</p>
<p>That rivalry hit a pause in this year’s January when Ronaldo went to Saudi Arabia to play for Al-Nassr.</p>
<p>There was still a slim chance of the rivalry resuming if Ronaldo, 38, could manage a return to a European club for one last dance, as the recently retired Zlatan Ibrahimovic did a few years ago when he joined AC Milan from MLS club Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>
<p>If not that, the football fans were hoping they could at least witness a diluted version of that rivalry if Messi accepted the billion-dollar offer and turn up at the Saudi league.</p>
<p>But Messi’s decision to move to Inter Miami all but confirms that the greatest rivalry in football history has reached its conclusion.</p>
<p>The rivalry begins<br />
Ronaldo made his professional debut for Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon in 2003, almost two years before Messi first played a match for the Barcelona senior team.</p>
<p>It didn’t take Ronaldo too long to join a top European club as Sir Alex Ferguson, coach of Manchester United, brought him to England which began a glorious six-year period in Ronaldo’s career where he won the Premier League, Champions League and his first Ballon d’Or.</p>
<p>Messi, on the other hand, quickly became the heart of the Barcelona side and under coach Pep Guardiola, won the Laliga thrice and also the Champions League.</p>
<p>But the rivalry between Ronaldo and Messi really kicked off in 2009, when Real Madrid brought Ronaldo from Manchester and positioned him right across Messi.</p>
<p>The arrival of Ronaldo, ironically, proved beneficial for Messi as the Portuguese in a way brought the best out of him, pushed him to reach his full potential and spurred him to win three Ballon d’Ors in a row.</p>
<p>The one-upmanship continues<br />
From 2009 to 2018, for nine years, the football world saw an incredible display of one-upmanship between Messi and Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Messi’s Barcelona dominated La Liga, winning six league titles in nine years. But Ronaldo still had the edge over Messi in terms of team accolades as he won the biggest prize in European football, the UEFA Champions League trophy four times.</p>
<p>However, Messi was a shade ahead when it came to individual prizes, winning the Ballon d’Or five times, compared to Ronaldo’s four wins.</p>
<p>Rivalry hits pause<br />
This incredible rivalry first hit a pause in 2018, when Ronaldo packed his bags and left Madrid for Turin to play for Italian giants Juventus.</p>
<p>Although in different leagues, the comparisons between the two icons didn’t stop. The fans still constantly compared their goal tally and assists made by the two and debates about who is better raged on.</p>
<p>In 2021, both Ronaldo and Messi switched clubs under drastically different circumstances.</p>
<p>Ronaldo left Juventus after three years and returned to Manchester United as its prodigal son.</p>
<p>On the other hand, after hearing that Messi re-signing with Barcelona is a matter of formality for months, at the eleventh hour Barcelona president Joan Laporta announced they can’t sign Messi, which shocked everyone, including Messi himself.</p>
<p>Within days, Messi bid a teary-eyed goodbye to Barcelona and joined the Qatar-backed French club Paris Saint Germain.</p>
<p>The end<br />
Although Ronaldo was in England and Messi in France, they were still in Europe at least, playing top-flight football.</p>
<p>But that also changed eventually.</p>
<p>Ronaldo had a public falling out with Manchester United, which included him going on an interview and ranting against the club right before the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Manchester United also retaliated by terminating his contract in November 2022.</p>
<p>After the World Cup, Ronaldo made the shock move of leaving Europe and going to the unheralded Saudi league to play for Al-Nassr.<br />
Messi’s time with PSG also ended in a less than amicable manner. The club brought in Messi and formed an outrageous attacking triumvirate with Messi, Neymar Junior and Kylian Mbappe in hopes of ending their drought of European success.</p>
<p>However, their dreams got crushed as even with Messi PSG couldn’t come in the vicinity of the Champions League title.</p>
<p>After it was announced that Messi won’t continue in Paris, the question arose, what’s next for Messi? The Argentine had a $1 billion offer spanning two years from Saudi club Al-Hilal, and a few other undisclosed European clubs also inquired.</p>
<p>But Messi had his heart set on a return to Barcelona.</p>
<p>He waited for the Catalan club to offer a proper deal but in return only got a half-baked proposal with several ifs and buts attached to it. Messi didn’t want to face a similar situation he faced two years back and decided to hitch his wagon with Inter Miami.</p>
<p>Messi and Ronaldo will now continue their careers on different continents. They will vie for different domestic and continental titles and their paths won’t cross in competitive club football.</p>
<p>A rivalry that enthralled millions for years has ended rather unceremoniously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie&#8217;s legal fight seems to be never-ending.</p>
<p>As per media, Pitt is now suing Jolie for selling her portion of their shared French vineyard without consulting him.</p>
<p>The Oscar-winning actor claimed in new court documents that amid the continued war in Ukraine &#8212; the association presents an “existential threat to the business” due to the new part owner’s tie to Russia.</p>
<p>The first amended complaint about the winery, filed in February 2022, sought damages for declaratory relief, disgorgement, and damages, along with pre and post-judgment interest for the defendants&#8217; alleged tortious interference with contractual relations.</p>
<p>In legal documents obtained by a media outlet, the complaint alleged that Jolie sold her interests in the property to Tenute del Mondo, whose parent company is the spirits manufacturer Stoli Group, which is &#8220;controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shefler&#8217;s Russia-affiliated spirits conglomerate has been the subject of repeated boycotts in connection with Vladimir Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and homophobic legislative Agenda,&#8221; the lawsuit stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Shefler may be seeking to launder his reputation by forcing a partnership with one of the world&#8217;s most well-known and popular actors, affiliation with Shefler and Stoli jeopardises the reputation of the business that Pitt so carefully built with Perrin and with which Pitt has so closely and carefully associated himself and his image.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pitt reportedly learned of Jolie&#8217;s alleged putative sale via a press release.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims the purported sale was &#8220;unlawful&#8221; due to &#8220;contractual agreement&#8221; breaches between Jolie and Pitt &#8220;to hold Miraval together and not sell their interests separately without the other&#8217;s consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pitt and Jolie gained a controlling interest in Miraval in 2008. They began selling their own rose in March 2013 and got married at the chateau in August 2014.</p>
<p>Pitt alleges that when Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, they both agreed not to sell their Miraval shares without each other&#8217;s permission. , US Magazine reported.</p>
<p>However, in 2021, the Girl Interrupted star sold her portion of the business to Tenute del Mondo.</p>
<p>In September 2016, the Gia actress filed for divorce from Pitt after two years of marriage and 12 years together.</p>
